        <h1 class="c-title1">Our Story</h1>
        <p class="c-description1">
            One in five people in Hong Kong is living under the poverty line. Many <br/>
            stay in cage homes and struggle to pay their monthly bill. <br/>
            <br/>
            Unknowingly, there are many resources offered by NGO’s, tech <br/>
            corporations, SME’s, and startups, such as donation, day care centers, <br/>
            non-traditional courses, and workshops. <br/>
            <br/>
            Therefore, Necessiti’s vision is to connect with the 600,000 families living <br/>
            in poverty in Hong Kong with more than 800 NGO’s and tech-impact <br/>
            solutions through one platform. Our objective is to empower families so <br/>
            they can worry less about their financial situations and help unleash their <br/>
            growth potential.

                Our solution is to provide a one-stop platform that allows low-income <br/>

                available to them according to their specific needs.
